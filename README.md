# Go Programming Assignment: ScyllaDB Rate Limiter Application

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to create a Go command-line application that inserts random data into ScyllaDB while rate-limiting the number of requests. This exercise will help you understand how to interact with databases using Go, manage concurrency, and implement rate limiting.

## Task Description

You are required to develop a Go application that:

- **Data Insertion**: Inserts random data into ScyllaDB using the `gocql` driver.
- **Parallel Execution**: Performs queries in parallel with a customizable maximum parallelism.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting to control the number of requests per second.
- **Configurability**: Accepts command-line arguments to set:
    - `--parallelism N`: Specifies that N queries should be performed concurrently.
    - `--rate-limit M`: Specifies that at most M requests per second should be performed.
- **Metrics Reporting**: Periodically prints statistics, including the number of requests performed, average latencies, and the P99 latency metric.

## Requirements

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Dependencies**:
    - Use only the standard library (`stdlib`), the `gocql` driver, and/or supplementary repositories (`golang.org/x/*`).
    - **gocql driver repository**: [https://github.com/scylladb/gocql](https://github.com/scylladb/gocql)

## Suggested Data Model

You may define your own data model, but here's a simplified example inspired by [Discord's data storage for messages](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-trillions-of-messages):

```cql
CREATE TABLE messages (
   channel_id bigint,
   bucket int,
   message_id bigint,
   author_id bigint,
   content text,
   PRIMARY KEY ((channel_id, bucket), message_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (message_id DESC);
```

You can configure the cluster size and other keyspace-related settings as needed.
## Instructions

You can run ScyllaDB locally using Docker with the following command:

```
docker run --name scylla -d \
  -p 9042:9042 \
  -p 9160:9160 \
  scylladb/scylla:6.1.2
```

## Running the application

You should let us be able to run the app using the current command line arguments:
```
go run main.go --parallelism 50 --rate-limit 500
```


## Submission Guidelines

1. **Submit via Pull Request**: Create a Pull Request with your solution. Document your approach, any difficulties encountered, and how they were addressed.
2. **Documentation**: Update the README file to include a description of data types used and provide detailed instructions on how to run your application.
3. **Do Not Reference Other Solutions**: Avoid checking out other implementations until you have completed your submission.
